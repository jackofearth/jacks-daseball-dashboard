echo "**Successes:**"
echo "- Systematic Problem-Solving: Methodical debugging approach with debug logs → verification → cleanup"
echo "- User-Centric Iteration: Rapid adaptation to user feedback on functionality and UI"
echo "- Code Quality Maintenance: Immediate removal of debug code after verification"
echo "- Git Workflow Excellence: Proper file restoration from git history and clean commit practices"
echo "- Documentation Integration: Successful restoration and integration of automated systems"
echo ""
echo "**Failures & User Corrections:**"
echo "- Debug-First Approach: Initially added debugging without verifying basic functionality"
echo "- Warning Ignorance: Failed to investigate git hook warnings immediately"
echo "- Overconfident Implementation: Assumed functionality was working without user verification"
echo ""
echo "**Actionable Lessons:**"
echo "- Test basic functionality before adding debug code"
echo "- Investigate git hook warnings immediately rather than ignoring them"
echo "- Implement user testing feedback rapidly and iteratively"
echo "- Remove debug code immediately after verification to maintain production quality"
echo "- Use git history effectively to restore accidentally deleted files"

echo "📊 Phase 3: Final Report"
echo "========================"
echo ""
echo "**Doctrine Update Summary:**"
echo "- **Updated:** .cursorrules (Project Doctrine)"
echo "- **Changes:** Enhanced debugging protocols, user feedback integration, and proactive issue detection"
echo "- **Impact:** Prevents debug-first failures, improves warning response, accelerates user feedback loops"

echo "**Session Learnings:**"
echo "- Systematic problem-solving patterns lead to efficient outcomes"
echo "- User testing feedback is critical for functionality verification"
echo "- Proactive warning investigation prevents blocking issues"
echo "- Clean code practices maintain production quality"

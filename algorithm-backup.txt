BASEBALL MANAGER DASHBOARD - BATTING ORDER ALGORITHM BACKUP
================================================================
Last Updated: 2025-09-07 at 10:32:14 PM
Version: Enhanced Traditional Algorithm v2.0

PLAYER INTERFACE:
================
interface Player {
  name: string;
  avg: number;           // Batting Average
  obp: number;           // On-Base Percentage
  slg: number;           // Slugging Percentage
  ops: number;           // On-base Plus Slugging
  sb: number;            // Stolen Bases
  sbPercent: number;     // Stolen Base Percentage
  bbK: number;           // Walks per Strikeout
  contactPercent: number; // Contact Percentage
  qabPercent: number;    // Quality At-Bat Percentage
  baRisp: number;        // Batting Average with Runners in Scoring Position
  twoOutRbi: number;     // 2-out RBI production
  xbh: number;           // Extra-base hits
  hr: number;            // Home runs
  tb: number;            // Total bases
}

COLUMN DETECTION:
================
The algorithm automatically detects columns by searching for keywords in the first row's values:
- Name columns: Contains "name", "first", or "last"
- AVG column: Contains "AVG"
- OBP column: Contains "OBP"
- SLG column: Contains "SLG"
- OPS column: Contains "OPS"
- SB column: Contains "SB" (but not "SB%")
- SB% column: Contains "SB%"
- BB/K column: Contains "BB/K"
- C% column: Contains "C%"
- QAB% column: Contains "QAB%"
- BA/RISP column: Contains "BA/RISP"
- 2OUTRBI column: Contains "2OUTRBI"
- XBH column: Contains "XBH"
- HR column: Contains "HR"
- TB column: Contains "TB"

BATTING ORDER STRATEGY:
======================

1. LEAD-OFF (1st Position):
   Weight Formula: OBP * 0.5 + SB% * 0.2 + Contact% * 0.2 + AVG * 0.1
   Strategy: High on-base percentage is the top priority, with speed and contact as secondary factors.

2. SECOND (2nd Position):
   Weight Formula: Contact% * 0.4 + BA/RISP * 0.3 + AVG * 0.2 + QAB% * 0.1
   Strategy: High contact rate with situational hitting ability to move runners.

3. THIRD (3rd Position):
   Weight Formula: OPS * 0.7 + QAB% * 0.3
   Strategy: Best overall hitter with quality at-bats, often gets the most at-bats.

4. CLEAN-UP (4th Position):
   Weight Formula: SLG * 0.4 + 2OUTRBI * 0.3 + XBH * 0.2 + BA/RISP * 0.1
   Strategy: Power hitter with clutch RBI production and extra-base hit ability.

5. FIFTH Position:
   Weight Formula: SLG * 0.4 + BA/RISP * 0.3 + OPS * 0.2 + 2OUTRBI * 0.1
   Strategy: Second-best power hitter with clutch hitting ability.

6-9. REMAINING Positions:
   Strategy: Fill remaining spots by descending OPS order.

ALGORITHM LOGIC:
===============
1. Parse CSV data and skip the first row (contains column names)
2. Extract player stats using detected column names
3. Filter players with valid names and batting stats
4. Apply position-specific selection criteria
5. Ensure no player is used twice
6. Fill remaining positions by OPS ranking

DISPLAY FEATURES:
================
- Shows player name and position number
- Displays core stats: AVG, OBP, SLG
- Shows additional stats when available: SB%, RISP, Contact%
- Clean, numbered interface with baseball theming

TECHNICAL NOTES:
===============
- Uses TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Handles missing or invalid data gracefully
- Provides debug information when no batting order is generated
- Automatically adapts to different CSV column structures
- Fallback to calculated OPS if OPS column not found
